> ### The Idea behind this was to have a robot arm that could maintain a constaint height and change length and rotation, enabling the bot to move in a `(x,y)` coordinate field.

### Getting Started

#### The first thing that has to happen is changing the length to keep one coordinate constant:

![Moving in 1 axis by rotation](/3.1.7/Documentation/Moving%20in%201%20axis%20by%20rotation%20while%20keeping%20the%20other%20constant.png)

#### The next is keeping the height the same while changing the length:
![Maintaining Constant Height While Changing Length](/3.1.7/Documentation/Maintaining%20Constant%20Height%20While%20Changing%20Length%20Scan%20ReColor.png)

#### Once I figured out what I needed to do, I had to figure out how to calibrate it.
> ##### I decided to calibrate it by putting limit switches on the ends of the rotation, and encoders on the motors.  The way this works is by counting the number of degrees the motor turns between the maximum and minimum positions of the arm.

### After calibration, the next thing to do is be able to move the bot's joints ***at the same speed***.

> #### To do this, I assumed some stuff that I probably shouldn't've.

### Because I didn't have enough time to do all of this, the project rapidly devolved...

## Robot Arm Programming 

I'm currently working on a *whole* new set of things from what I'm used to.
